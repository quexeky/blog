Alright, here we go again. This is the second time in two days that I'm trying to set up a blog, for a whole heap of things. *Hopefully*, it'll work better this time, but to be honest, I'm not incredibly hopeful. So far I've been trying Ghost, and while it is an exceptional project, I just don't have the resources to be running it well enough. Plus something with my cloudflare tunneling setup, and my adoration of efficiency means that hosting a blog with Hugo through Cloudflare (Workers or Pages? I spent far too many hours debugging everything and reading through everything to realise that I was trying to deploy on the wrong one :/), and then trying to strap a few services to it that don't affect how other people interact with it.

Oh well. Hugo and Decap CMS are ready, so here's a first post and enjoy while I spend another like 10 hours suffering for it.
